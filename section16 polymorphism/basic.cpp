// Static binding happens when all information needed to call a function is available at the

// *A base class pointer can point to a derived class object, but we can only access base class
// *member or virtual functions using the base class pointer because object slicing happens when
// *a derived class object is assigned to a base class object. Additional attributes of a derived
// *class object are sliced off to form the base class object.

// A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined (overridden)
// by a derived class. When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class,
// you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s version of the function.

// Virtual functions ensure that the correct function is called for an object, regardless of the type of reference
//  (or pointer) used for function call.
// They are mainly used to achieve Runtime polymorphism
// Functions are declared with a virtual keyword in base class.
// The resolving of function call is done at runtime.

// *Rules for Virtual Functions
// Virtual functions cannot be static.
// A virtual function can be a friend function of another class.
// Virtual functions should be accessed using pointer or reference of base class type to achieve runtime polymorphism.
// The prototype of virtual functions should be the same in the base as well as derived class.
// They are always defined in the base class and overridden in a derived class. It is not mandatory for the
//  derived class to override (or re-define the virtual function), in that case, the base class version of the function is used.
// A class may have virtual destructor but it cannot have a virtual constructor
